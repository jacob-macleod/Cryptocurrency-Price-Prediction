## Progress of project
I began by trying to predict a small section of the code. That didn't work well. I tweaked model characteristics and tried again. It still didn't work. I created a new dataset and tried to predict the change in price, not the price itself. Running this came up with an error while predicting values. However, predicting values using previously written code worked. I was able to see the prediction, but it still didn't work, and only vaugely followed a trend.

Now, I'm not sure what to do or how to fix it to make it better.
